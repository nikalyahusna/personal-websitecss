<p>My hobbie that i like to spend with is doing make up. I love watching tutorial make up on youtube
and learn from them. I can gain more knowledge, skills and tecnic on how to do that. Doing make up is easy for me as long as you dont quit
practicing over and over again. My friends on Instagram often ask me to do tutorial makeup video but im too shy to do it! Here are some picture of me
doing fun and colourful make up, it reminds me of unicorn!</p>

<p>Last but not least, my third hobby is watching movies! Every single night my routine before bed is i will watch one movie from Netflix.
Im more into action movie than horror movie because obviously im scared ugh. Currently my favourite action movie will be The Hunger Games series!
But since i already start my classes which i need to wake up early in the morning, i rarely watch movie anymore. But still watching movie will be my 
favourite hobbie!</p>
